description: 'A rough opinion on the current IT hiring processes trend.'
---

Maybe after this post I have to really start thinking about becoming a youtuber to yell my opinions directly from a microphone to your computer screen.

Jokes aside, I’d like to talk about some things I’ve found during the hiring processes I’ve been involved with. Not all processes are the same, someone have been really interesting and I’ve dropped (or been dropped) from several. This said, I’ve checked LinkedIn for five minutes and collected some interesting points I’ve found in the jobs description. I hope this helps to explain my point of view regarding this topic.

### You have to do this technical assignment before meeting the team or doing any technical interview

Because nobody cares about what your opinions on the team are. Nobody cares about what your feelings are regarding your potential new colleagues or if you think you’ll fit there. **They are too focused on their problems* to really care about a potential employee. It’s kind of the *mentality of the king in a castle waiting a new buffoon to entertain him**. So, take between 12 to 16 hours of your spare time (this means, take these hours from your family and things that make you happy like hobbies or sports) for coding a really well thought technical assignment. Wait, did I say well thought? sorry, what I actually tried to say is that you’re going to be given the same test you’ve already coded in almost every process you’ve been involved. **Algorithms and coding challenges from GitHub are the usual test of choice.**

### You will be part of the overall RANDOM_COMPANY community of SPECIFIC_TECHNOLOGY developers, sharing best practices, knowledge, and code

It’s amazing! every company out there states for the same. This is the point where I actually test the company/team. What happens when you don’t implement your technical assignment the dogmatic way? with that, I mean: **what happens if you KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) instead of “following” SOLID “by the book”?**. The result usually is the same: **they expect a classic VIPER/Clean Architecture/Hexagonal architecture** seen over and over again in tons of posts and they’re not really open to the change. This pretty much conflicts with the concept of pragmatism.

### Profound knowledge of SOME FRAMEWORK

Because the ability of change is not preferred. **It’s better if you already know everything about the framework and have no idea about what single responsibility means** than having someone that actually cares about the software quality and maintainability and teach them what they need to know about this particular framework.

This also is a cool spot during the review of your technical assignment. If you know a lot about architecture, they will focus on the framework. If you know a lot about the framework, they will be interested in the architecture.

### Training, conferences and many opportunities to learn, experiment and grow

But… If I have to self-teach myself because the company is not willing to help me with that, and I have to already have a deep understanding of ALL your stack… what are my opportunities to learn exactly?

### Flexible working hours

Are you sure we’re not talking about fake flexible working hours (you join the company and then they tell you you’re going to stay everyday from 9h to 18h) or a huge amount of “core” hours (we have flexible working hours BUT we have to stay here from 9 to 16). 16 - 9 = 7, if I work 8 hours and I have already 7 hours fixed… where is the flexibility at?

### A stunning office located in the centre of your town

It will provide enough comfort to not have to worry about your fake flexible working hours and it will motivate you to do overtime.

### Competitive salary and a Permanent contract

Until you talk with the recruiters and they try to underpay you. A cool trend right now is telling this amazing story about “Flexible Compensation Plan: Health insurance/ Transport/ Nursery Tickets”. It’s like: I’m not going to pay you what you ask for, but hey, you have this cool things you didn’t ask for and maybe if we sum everything up, the result will be the exact amount you asked for!

I like to talk about money right at the end of the post because it gives an interesting picture of the whole process: **We want a rockstar, we don’t want to pay for a rockstar.**
