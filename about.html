<h1>I love the the software craftsman path and the polyglote technologist culture</h1>

<div>
  <p>My goal is to share with use useful and interesting tech-related things and soft-skills that changed my relationship with software development</p>
  <p>I am an Android Developer and a Software Craftsman. I strongly believe that technical knowledge is not enough to do our work. We need to be constantly curious and open-minded. Pragmatism and knowledge-sharing are necessary to leave a good impact in our codebase. I hope my posts open an internal debate on you.</p>
